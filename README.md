# TicTacToe
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against your computer on the command line.
You can choose between three different levels of your opponent.
In order to play the game, you need to run the PlayGame.py program.

On the following website you can find the rules for this game: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-Tac-Toe .

<b>NOTE:</b> at the moment the opponent makes only random choices and choosing another difficulty doesn't influence it's behaviour. However, I'll add this soon.
